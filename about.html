            <h1>BIO</h1>
            <p>Ceramic artist Erin Hupp (she/her) collaborates with fine dining restaurants to create bespoke hand-thrown tableware pieces which bring the chef's vision to life. Erin also collaborates with interior designers to create unique, custom objects of art designed intentionally for the home. Her work can currently be experienced at Californios, Nightbird, Sons and Daughters, Pasta Bar, Acquerello, Sorrel, and Stanly Ranch Auberge Resort. </p>
            <p>Erin has been creating her art, by hand, on her potter’s wheel for the past 20+ years. She has been a pottery teacher, a production potter, an art camp counselor, and managed a pottery studio. In her previous lives, Erin has worked in Yellowstone National Park, waitressed at a beach cafe in Manly, Australia, bartended at a jazz club and practiced land use law and child welfare law. She holds a Juris Doctor and a Masters in Urban Planning from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and a Bachelors of Science from the University of Wisconsin at Madison. Erin resides in Oakland, CA with her husband, two daughters and son. When she is not elbow deep in clay, she's chasing her children, hiking, or dreaming up the next big family travel adventure.</p>

            <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
            <p>My practice thrives on mutual collaboration with other artists, from interior designers and chefs to floral designers and metalsmiths. These collaborations continually help me refine and redefine my practice, push my limits and build trust in my process. I feel honored to continue the rich history of clay, one of the oldest forms of art that combines both craft and aesthetic.</p>
            <p>From inception to execution, I consider how my art will exist in a particular space and environment; each piece is handcrafted with that in mind. In restaurants, my ceramics provide the architecture for the chef’s menu and how it will exist within the restaurant space. Ultimately I see the restaurant as a live, ever-evolving gallery in which people can touch, hold, feel, interact and experience my ceramics. Ceramics tell the story of my collaboration with the chef through deliberate and artful plating.</p>
